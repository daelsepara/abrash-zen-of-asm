# About this version

This version was created from the conversions which Ron Welch made of the book from CD of the [Black Book of Graphics Programming](http://www.jagregory.com/abrash-black-book/). Without Ron's effort, this version would either have not been possible, or would've been considerably more difficult. My intention is to maintain a canonical electronic version of the book, and make it easier to read in other formats and on other devices than were available when the book was released online.

Below is the history of the book in Ron Welch's hands, and shows quite how much effort was involved on his part.

## The Ron Welch version

In 2011 we obtained a CD image dated 1997 that was the companion disk for Michael Abrash's Graphics Programming Black Book with numerous files on it including one containing the following message:

> In 1989, Michael Abrash completed \*the\* classic work on 8088-oriented code optimization. ZEN OF ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE was published by Scott, Foresman & Company as part of a series of assembly books edited by Jeff Duntemann. Unfortunately, not long after the book was published, Scott, Foresman was acquired by Harper Collins, and the larger firm chose not to continue the Scott, Foresman computer trade line. 200 books perished in the acquisition, and while the world was better off without most of them, ZEN OF ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE vanished as well.
>
> In the intervening years, since quantities of the book in stores were exhausted, many people have asked for reprints of ZEN OF ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE. The economies of publishing do not allow it to be reprinted in its original form, but Michael has arranged to make the book available as a set of word processor files on the CD-ROM for the second edition of ZEN OF GRAPHICS PROGRAMMING.
>
> There was insufficient time to include scanned bitmaps of the many figures in ZEN OF ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE on this first pressing of the CD-ROM, but the figures will be available on the Coriolis Web Site: [http://www.coriolis.com](http://www.coriolis.com), under book diskette files. Alternately, you can locate the files through ftp from directory [ftp://coriolis.com/pub/bookdisk/](ftp://coriolis.com/pub/bookdisk/) in several files in the form ZOAFIG??.ZIP, where ?? will be a two-digit number representing the chapter from which the figures were taken. If a chapter is not represented it means that that chapter contained no figures.
>
> Future pressings of the CD-ROM will contain all of the figure bitmap files as well as the text.
>
> The text files are in two formats on the CD-ROM. One, in the WP42 subdirectory of ZOA, is the Word Perfect 4.2 format, which is still readily importable to many major word processors. The other is RTF, in the RTF subdirectory of ZOA, which is the Rich Text Format, which is easily importable by Microsoft Word and most newer word processors.
>
> All of the chapters are present except for Chapter 6, which has become lost. Chapter 6 simply contains an overview of the 8088 processor, which can be had in other older books on PC assembly language. Michael did not get into any of his trademark Zen insights in Chapter 6. It was presented strictly as foundation knowledge.
>
> The code listings for the book are contained in a self-extracting archive file ZEN_LIST.EXE. Copy this file to a subdirectory and execute it. The listing files will be extracted into the subdirectory.

The websites at the above URLs do not function any more but there were some .tif versions off the figures on the CD. The figures were poor quality scans so we redrew them for this version. A few figures were missing so we recreated them too.

This electronic version was created to provide an digital version for reading on computers or portable book readers. This is a restoration of the book issued on CD containing the original copyrighted content, offered here in this format with the permission of Michael Abrash the author.

We transferred the RTF files to MS Word 2007, reformatted some parts, put some information in tables, created hyperlinks and bookmarks, inserted the figures and generated a PDF.

Appendix B and Chapter 6 were missing from the CD, so we recreated them.

The original book had the program listings embedded in the text. The RTF files on the CD did not include the listings text, so a section was added containing the listings and hyperlinked to references in the Chapter text. Click on the listing title in the text to go to the listing. Click on the listing title to return to the first mention of the listing in the text.

We added some color in the figures and used a colored font for all code in the book (the original book was printed in black and white). We own a print copy of the book, so we were able to create a cover image and use OCR to help recreate Chapter 6.

The ZEN_LIST.EXE on the CD contained the programs but doesn't auto extract on modern Windows operating systems. We were able to extract the files with WINRAR. The Listings for Chapter 15 were missing, so we recreated them from the book.

The table of contents hyperlinks will take you to the listed title. Clicking on the title will take you back to the table of contents page.

We doubt that there are many 8088 machines left running but there might be some simulators out there that will run the codeâ€” so this 21+ year old book, and the efforts made to create this electronic version might be considered a waste of time. Having written assembly code during the era of this book and being inspired by it, were reasons enough to exert the effort. It is unfortunate that Michael was unable to produce the other planned volume; it might have proved to be one of the fundamental sources of assembly language programming techniques.
